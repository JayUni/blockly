# blockly
The web-based visual programming editor.

Issues:

1. all bloccks need to be on the same order
2. json format double checking
    2.1 Is it good to have json to non-statement blocks
3. test the combination of blocks for example block 1+1 does not work on substring block
4. variable and functions does not work
