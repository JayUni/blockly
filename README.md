# blockly
The web-based visual programming editor.

Issues:

1. all bloccks need to be on the same order
2. json format double checking
    2.1 Is it good to have json to non-statement blocks
3. test the combination of blocks for example block 1+1 does not work on substring block
4. variable and functions does not work
5. Is it good to do all the logics on the server and the json only has the results
